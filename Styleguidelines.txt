1. Variables, classes, methods should have meaningful names that explain what they do.
  ex: Use variable name Student instead of s1 s2 s3 etc
  
2. Class names must start with a capital letter.

3. Variable and method names must use camelCase. i.e First word starts with lower case letter and other words start with Uppercase.
  ex: getStudentId() , studentName, parentName etc
  
4. Constants should be all caps.
  ex: PI, TIME etc
